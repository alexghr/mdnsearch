#MDNSearch

A Chrome extension that adds the Omnibox keyword `mdn` for easy searching on Mozilla Developer Network.

## Installing
The plugin isn't yet available on the Chrome Web Store so for now you have to manually install it. 
After downloading the code you have to:

1. Go to Menu->Tools->Extensions
2. Enable Devloper Mode
3. Use Load Unpacked extensions to specify the folder where you downloaded the source code.

##Using
Start by typing the keyword, `mdn` in the Omnibox followed by a `Space` or a `Tab` and your query. The plugin will try to show suggestions for pages found on the Mozilla Developer Wiki. You can just press `Enter` to do a regular search on the wiki or use one of the suggestions to directly go to that page.
